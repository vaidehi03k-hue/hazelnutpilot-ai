------------
To run execute these:

1 - ollama serve
Leave this tab open. (Serves at http://localhost:11434)

2-  Start the backend API

New terminal:

cd ~/Desktop/qa-pilot          # or wherever you put it
npm install                    # first time only
npm run dev

3-  Start the UI

Another terminal:

cd ~/Desktop/qa-pilot/ui
npm install                    # first time only
npm run dev

4-  In the UI — Create Project

            Open http://localhost:5173.

            On Dashboard, type a project name (e.g. SauceDemo Tests).

            Click + New Project.

            You’ll see an alert with a “viewer link”. (Keep it; that’s shareable).

            Your project now appears under Projects list.

            Click Open → beside it to go to the Project page.

5- Upload the PRD

        In the Project page, click Choose File under Upload PRD.

        Select the file you made earlier: saucedemo-prd.md.

        Click Upload.

        A PRD ID should appear (this confirms upload worked).

6- Set Base URL

        In the Base URL input field, type:

        https://www.saucedemo.com/

7-  Generate Tests (AI)

        Click Generate Tests (AI).

        Wait a few seconds.

        The big JSON panel should now show test cases like “Login and Logout”.

8- Run Web Tests

        Click Run Web.

        The backend will open SauceDemo in a headless browser (via Playwright).

        It will try logging in with standard_user / secret_sauce, then logout.

        After the run finishes, you’ll see:

        Pass/Fail counts

        Links to screenshots & video

        A link to Issues.xlsx (Excel bug report)

9- Review Results

        Open Issues.xlsx → you’ll see step-by-step run logs with status (Pass/Fail).

        Screenshots/video are in the run folder (download links appear in UI).

        Run History table on Project page shows this run with timestamp.

10 -  Back to Dashboard

        Go back to Dashboard (http://localhost:5173/).

        You’ll see the donut chart (Passed/Failed) and bar chart (Recent Runs) updated.

        Click your project again to see multiple runs if you repeat.

🎯 What to say in demo

“Here’s my Dashboard where I manage projects.”

“I upload a PRD like this one for SauceDemo → AI generates tests automatically.”

“Then I click Run Web → It executes against the real website, records screenshots, and exports an Issues.xlsx bug sheet.”

“Dashboard updates with pass/fail charts. I can share this viewer link to stakeholders.”
